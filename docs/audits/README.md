# Architecture audits and feedback

> **Control plane.** This directory is maintained on the **`meta` branch** by
> Master Control. `FEEDBACK` files land here on `meta`; `REQ` files are
> *authored by Workers on their own feature branch* (that is their reporting
> channel) and copied to `meta` by Master Control at ingestion. Read the
> current state without checking out:
> `git fetch origin meta && git show origin/meta:docs/audits/<file>`.

CloFin is developed asynchronously: worker sessions implement briefs
continuously on stacked feature branches, while architecture review happens
**offline, at milestones, over batches of one to five PRs** — rather than
blocking each increment. This directory is where that review lands and becomes
durable.

**Naming:** `REQ` files are `NNN-REQ-<subject>.md` (a Worker's completion
report and audit request for `TASK-NNN`, including any objections to the brief
itself). `FEEDBACK` files are `FEEDBACK-NNN-<subject>.md`, matching the brief
they review, or a milestone name for a broader batch audit
(`FEEDBACK-M1-foundation.md`).

**Worker objections to a brief** travel in the `REQ`, never as edits to the
brief. Master Control arbitrates: correct the brief on `meta`, or answer the
objection with evidence and let the brief stand. Either way the ruling is
recorded, and if the brief changes, the owning Worker receives a specific fix
instruction naming the branch, the change, and the acceptance criteria that now
apply ([`../AGENT_HANDOFF.md`](../AGENT_HANDOFF.md) §1b).

> A review that exists only in a conversation does not exist. If an audit
> finding is worth acting on, it is worth committing here — otherwise the next
> session re-introduces the same anti-pattern, and the one after that re-argues
> whether it was a problem.

## What an audit produces

An audit is expected to state, for each finding:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| **Severity** | `blocking` · `should-fix` · `consider` |
| **Finding** | What is wrong, specifically, with a file and line where possible |
| **Why it matters** | The consequence — ideally in product or control terms, not only engineering ones |
| **Suggested direction** | Not necessarily a patch; a direction is enough |
| **Affects** | Which briefs or namespaces |

## How feedback is ingested

When a `FEEDBACK` file lands, the orchestrating session:

1. **Reads it in full** before touching any code.
2. **Triages each finding.** A finding is actioned, deferred with a stated
   reason, or disputed with evidence. All three are legitimate; silence is not.
3. **Applies blocking findings** to the code, and updates the affected brief's
   `Status` back to `IN PROGRESS` if it had been `IMPLEMENTED`.
4. **Propagates the lesson forward.** This is the part with lasting value: a
   flagged anti-pattern is added to the *Notes for whoever picks this up*
   section of every brief where it could recur, so it is prevented rather than
   re-corrected.
5. **Writes an ADR** if a finding changes a decision. An accepted ADR is never
   edited — it is superseded by a new one that links back
   ([ADR-0001](../ADR/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)).
6. **Records the disposition** in the Register below, and sets the brief's
   `Audit` field to reference the feedback file.

A finding that is disputed must be answered with evidence — a test, a
constraint, a benchmark — not with an assertion. The project's whole claim is
that its statements are checkable; that applies to its replies to reviewers too.

## Register

| Feedback | Reviews | Received | Findings (B/S/C) | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(waived)* | Increment 1 / PR #1 | 2026-08-02 | — | Deep architectural audit **explicitly bypassed** by the reviewer to unblock the pipeline, with rigorous review to be enforced from PR #2 onward. Recorded so the assurance history is honest: increment 1 was consciously not audited. |
| *(pending)* | Increment 2 / PR #2 — `001-REQ` filed by the Worker | requested 2026-08-02 | — | Awaiting `FEEDBACK-001` from the Principal Architect. |

## Standing lessons

Anti-patterns confirmed by audit, to be avoided in all future work. Each entry
names the brief section that now guards against it, so the guard can be checked.

| # | Anti-pattern | Guarded by |
|---|---|---|
| _(none yet — populated as audits arrive)_ | | |

Until an audit populates this table, the standing constraints are the ones in
[`../AGENT_HANDOFF.md`](../AGENT_HANDOFF.md) §3 — the rules that must not be
broken.
